# Welcome to my page!
My name is Rocco Peri, and I am a current student studying financial economics and Italian at Notre Dame, intending on going to law school post-grad. For research, I love studying networks, mental health outcomes, and financial data, and I hope that these interests of mine are apparent through my [Data Science Portfolio](https://github.com/roccoperi/PERI-Data-Science-Portfolio). In my spare time, I enjoy making cocktails for my friends, watching YouTube cooking tutorials, and powerlifting.
